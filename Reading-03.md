## Mustache and flexbox

- Mustache is widely know as logic-less templet syntax because it doesnâ€™t use if statements, else clauses of for loops instead it uses only tags. Some tags are replaced with a value, some nothing and others come with a series of values and they are used for HTML, config files, source code and really anything in-between it works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object. 
- Placeholder attribute gives us a limited information on certain values of an input field. It save space by not describing a large amount of format and just getting away with a hint of it like text, search, url, email and password. It is a shorter way to pass display in the input field before the user enters a value.

- Flexbox layout is a way that makes design flexible responsive web pages simpler without using floats or positioning. Before CSS flexbox there were four layout modes Block, Inline, Table and Positioned. 

- Flexbox has lots of CSS property aligns items. 
- Flex-start: Items will align to the top of the container.
- Flex-end: items will align to the bottom of the container.
- Center: this one is sort of self-explanatory and it allows items to align at the vertical center of the container. 
- Baseline: Items will display at the baseline of the container.
- Stretch: Items are stretched to fit the container.
