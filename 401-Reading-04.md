- Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
    1.	Better program design.
    2.	Higher code quality.
    3.	Reliable solution.

- In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
    1.	beforeEach( ) is used When a test makes any changes to conditions (requests) then you would need to use beforeEach( ).
    2.	afterEach( ) is used to signal that the annotated method should be executed after each test method in the current test class.

- What is one downside of Test Driven Development
    1.	That tests may not be completely deterministic (i.e. reliant on external dependencies)

- What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes		1.	ES6 class allows the developers to instantiate objects using the new operator.
    2.	Constructors focus on how the objects are instantiated. They also ensure the developer that this keyword which is basically used inside the class only refers to the object that is being created by the developer.
- Why REST?
    1. Because REST is an architectural style that handles the client-server relationship, with the purpose of aiming for speed and performance by using reusable components. 

	## Vocabulary terms

- Functional programming:- is a programming paradigm where you mostly construct and structure your code using functions.

- Object-oriented programming (OOP):- is a way of writing code that allows you to create different objects from a common object. The common object is usually called a blueprint while the created objects are called instances.

- Class: classes are template for creating objects

- Super: it refers to the parent class and usually used to call the constructor of the parent class and to access the parent’s properties and methods. 

- This: this keyword refers to the object it belongs to. It has different values depending on where it is used: In a method, this refers to the owner object. ... In a function, this refers to the global object. In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined 

- Jest:  jest is a test runner and assertion library. 

- Continuous integration(Cl):- is a pattern of programming combining testing, safety checks, and development practices to confidently push code from a development branch to production ready branch continuously

- Data Model:- Models are the heart of any JavaScript application, containing the interactive data as well as a large part of the logic surrounding it: conversions, validations, computed properties, and access control.
