## Tree

## Today we covered the two kind of trees Binary tree and Binary search tree (BST)

- Binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

- Binary search tree (BST) also called an ordered or sorted binary tree, is a rooted binary tree whose internal nodes each store a key greater that all the keys in the node’s left subtree and less than those in its right subtree.

- Node - is a structure which may contain a value or condition, or represent a separate data structure (which could be a tree of its own). Each node in a tree has zero or more child nodes, which are below it in the tree (by convention, trees are drawn growing downwards).
•	Edge - a connection between two nodes
•	Root - The top node in a tree (a node without a parent)
•	Parent node - A node connected to another node when moving towards the root
•	Child node- a node linked to another node when moving away from root or it’s a node that has a parent node. 
•	Descendant - a node reachable by repeated processing from parent to child
•	Ancestor - a node reachable by repeated processing from child to parent
•	Leaf - a node without any children. A leaf can also be called a leaf node. 
•	Degree - the number of sub trees of a node
•	Path - a sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node with a descendant
•	Depth - the depth of a node is the number of edges from the node to the tree’s root node
•	Subtree - of a tree T is a tree consisting of a node in T and all of it’s descendants 
•	Recursion is when the function which calls the same function, is known as recursive function. Recursion is defined as defining anything in terms of itself
•	Traversal also known as (tree search) is a form of graph traversal and refers to the process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each node in a tree data structure, exactly once. Such traversals are classified by the order in which the nodes are visited.”
