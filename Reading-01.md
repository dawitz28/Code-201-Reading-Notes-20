# Responsive Web Design #

- Responsive web designing allows your web page to fit screen and look decent on all sort of devices like tablet, mobile phones and desk tops. Responsive Web Design is not a program or a JavaScript it just uses HTML and CSS to make things happen internally without leaving out any information to fit much smaller devices, but it makes it work by adapting its content to fit any device by turning them into a sandwich bar or drop window.

## Responsive Web Design is broken down into three main components as followed.
Flexible Layouts, media queries and flexible media.

- Flexible Layout is a way of building the layout of a website using measuring length units that are regularly known as percentages or em units. This length units are what used to declare common grid property values such as width, margin or padding. 

- Media Queries allows as to specify different styles of devices style and sizes. It gives us a flexibility to get creative and target a certain width of the viewport or device. 

- Flexible Media is a way of adjusting the media images as the viewport size changes from device to device the flexible media resizes itself by scaling up or down according to its containers width by using the max-width property with a value of 100%. 
 
- Viewport is the area where the image or something visible takes place area of a web page. The viewport changes with different devices as it starts out with only made for desktops now that we have tablets and mobile phones to display images and videos and the viewport of desktop were to large for smaller devices to fix this problem now we have those devices scaled down to entire web page to fit the screens of smaller devices.
