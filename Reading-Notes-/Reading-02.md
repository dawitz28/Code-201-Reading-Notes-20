- JQUERY:- makes it easier to accomplish lots of common JavaScript codes in a much faster and reliable way on most if not all major browsers without any additional fallback codes needed.
Select elements:- it is much easier to select elements using JQuery’s css-style rather than using DOM Queries. The selectors are also more powerful and flexible.
Perform Tasks:- Jquery’s methods allows us to update and modify the DOM tree, animate elements into and out of view, also loop through a set of elements all in one line of code.
Handle events:- Jquery has methods that allow us to attach event listeners to select elements without having to write any fallback code to support older browsers.  
 
#What is JQUERY?#	
-	jQuery is a JavaScript file that we include in our web pages in order to select the different elements using CSS-style selectors and style using JQuery methods.
jQuery similarities to DOM:
-	the selectors perform in a similar manner to traditional DOM, but the syntax are much simpler. 
-	You can store the jQuery object in a variable just as we can with the DOM nodes.
-	We can also use jQuery methods and properties just like we do with DOM methods to manipulate the DOM nodes that we select. 

#jQuery differences from DOM#
-	The event handling is much simpler as it uses one method that works in all major browsers.
-	 Selecting elements is easier, because it uses CSS-style syntax that are straight forward and more accurate. 
-	Additional methods are available for bigger projects or popular required tasks like animation.
-	Once you make a selection on element you can apply multiple methods to it. 
Why do we use jQuery?
-	jQuery is not that much special tool than JavaScript or you can’t do anything that you will not be able to do with JavaScript, but as a file of JavaScript it makes coding much simpler. 

#Pair programming#

#6 reasons for pair programming.#
-	Greater efficiency: Pair programming might take a bit longer to get the job done at times, but you’ll have more quality work that saves you time on reviewing, troubleshooting and debugging. Whenever pair programmers get stuck, both programmers can research the problem and reach a solution faster. It also seems like it enhances technical skills, team communication and even enjoyability of coding in the workplace or at school.

-	Engaged collaboration: Usually when pair programming we tend to focus on problem that we’re trying to solve since we have someone else who is relying on us to participate; therefore we are less likely to get distracted or get side tracked. When we pair program we rely more on each other and we can often tend to find a solution together by masterminding without needing to ask for additional help which is what builds our self-confidence and push us to preform better.   


-	Learning from fellow students: We all have different ways to approaching problems and addressing them, so when we pair program there are endless problem solving techniques we can expose ourselves as well as our pair programmers while learning different unique approach to a new solution.

-	Social skills: When we pair program we sharpen our own communication skills, learn to be patients, learn different coding style and lot more office or co-working skills which will be a long-term asset and career impacts. Its one thing to know how to be a strong programmer, but knowing how to work with people and being a good communicator is just as important to employers. 

-	Job interview readiness: most of the skills we develop during pair programming might come handy when it comes to getting a job as most interview process involves pair programming either in person. This pair programming event usually allows an employers to determine if the candidate they have what it takes when it comes to carrying out exercises, such as code challenges, building a project or feature, or debugging an existing code base. All this takes place to get a better feel of the applicant and how well they work with co-workers during pair programming as a collaborator which says so much about the applicant outside of the programming skill sets.    

-	Work environment readiness: Many companies that uses pair programming during their hiring process expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product. Starting pair programming at early as we do here at Code Fellows and familiarize ourselves with how pairing works may find the path to be a bit easier.
