// creating variables
var today = new Date();
var hourNow = today.getHours();
var greeting;

// fining the hour is it by using the if statment
if(hourNow > 18){
    greeting = 'Good evening!';
} else if (hourNow > 12) {
    greeting = 'Good afternoon!';
} else if (hourNow > 0){
    greeting = 'Good morning';
} else{
    greeting = 'Welcome!';
}

// displaying the "greeting with the h3 header"
document.write('<h3>' + greeting + '</h3>');

Class 3 notes
List (HTML CHP 3)
Ordered list
<ol>
The ordered list is created with the <ol> element
<li>
Each itme in the list is placed between an opening <li> tag and a closing </li>tag.
Unordered lists
<ul>
The unordered list is created with the <ul> element.
<li>
Each itme in the list is placed between an opening <li> and a closing </li>.
DefinitionLists
<dl>
The Definition List is created using the <dl> element and usually consist of series of terms and thier definitions. Inside, you will see a series of terms <dt> and their definitions <dd> elements.
<dt>
this is used to contain the term being defined (the definition tem)
<dd>
this is used to contain the definition
Nested List
<ul>
    <li>Mousses</li>
    <li>Pastries
        <ul>
            <li>Croissant</li>
            <li>Mile-feuille</li>
            <li>palmier</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Tarts</li>

Boxes
Box Dimensions (width, height)
By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents. To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties.
The most popular ways to specify the size of a box are to use pixels, percentages, or ems. Traditionally, pixels have been the most popular method because they allow designers to accurately control their size.
When you use percentages, the size of the box is relative to the size of the browser window or, if the box is encased within another box, it is a percentage of the size of the containing box
When you use ems, the size of the box is based on the size of text within it. Designers have recently started to use percentages and ems more for measurements as they try to create designs that are flexible across devices which have different-sized screens.
In the example on the right, you can see that a containing <div> element is used which is 300 pixels wide by 300 pixels high. Inside of this is a paragraph that is 75% of the width and height of the containing element. This means that the size of the paragraph is 225 pixels wide by 225 pixels high.
limiting width (min-width, max-width)
ome page designs expand and shrink to fit the size of the user's screen. In such designs, the min-width property specifies the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser window is narrow, and the max-width property indicates the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide.
These are very helpful properties to ensure that the content of pages are legible (especially on the smaller screens of handheld devices). For example, you can use the max-width property to ensure that lines of text do not appear too wide within a big browser window and you can use the min-width property to make sure that they do not appear too narrow.
You may find it helpful to try this example out in your browser so that you can see what happens when you increase or decrease the size of the browser window.
Please note that these properties were first supported in IE7 and Firefox 2 so they will not work in older versions of these browsers.
limiting height (min-height, max-height)
In the same way that you might want to limit the width of a box on a page, you may also want to limit the height of it. This is achieved using the min-height and max-height properties.
The example on this page demonstrates these properties in action. It also shows you what happens when the content of the box takes up more space than the size specified for the box.
If the box is not big enough to hold the content, and the content expands outside the box it can look very messy. To control what happens when there is not enough space for the content of a box, you can use the overflow property, which is discussed on the next page.
overflwing content (Overflow)
The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have one of two values:
hidden
This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in the box.
scroll
This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content.
On the left, you can see two boxes whose contents expand beyond their set dimensions. The first example has the overflow property with a value of hidden. The second example has the overflow property with a value of scroll.
The overflow property is particularly handy because some browsers allow users to adjust the size of the text to appear as large or as small as they want. If the text is set too large then the page can become an unreadable mess. Hiding the overflow on such boxes helps prevent items overlapping on the page.
boder width (boder-width)
The border-width property is used to control the width of a border. The value of this property can either be given in pixels or using one of the following values:
•	thin
•	medium
•	thick
(You cannot use percentages with this property.) You can control the individual size of borders using four separate properties:
•	border-top-width
•	border-right-width
•	border-bottom-width
•	border-left-width
You can also specify different widths for the four border values in one property, like so:
border-width: 2px 1px 1px 2px;
The values here appear in clockwise order: top, right, bottom, left.
IF...Else statments
Here you can see that an if...e1se statement allowsyou to provide two sets of code:
1.	one set if the condition evaluates to true
2.	another set if the condition is false
In this test, there are two possible outcomes: a user can either get a score equal to or greater than the pass mark (which means they pass), or they can score less than the pass mark (which means they fail). One response is required for each eventuality. The response is then written to the page.
Note that the statements inside an if statement should be followed by a semicolon, but there is no need to place one after the closing curly brace of the code blocks.
