## Ejs Partials ## 
- Partials is a way to make HTML pages reusable through out multiple views. When you have big websites where you have multiple HTML pages on it and you need to change some information on it instead of going to every single page to do that you can easily update that reusable bunch of code in a file and just include it wherever you need it.  

- In * EJS * any JavaScript or non-HTML syntax you include in your templates is always surrounded by <% %> delimiters. If you really want to change these delimiters you can. 

- The we are using the partial file in EJS it makes it very useful by saving time and making your code that much cleaner. Instead of have to create codes for navigation bar, header and footers you can just create them once elsewhere and you can just plug that stored info as needed of different pages.
